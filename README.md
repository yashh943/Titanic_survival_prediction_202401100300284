🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to develop a classification model that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing historical passenger data, the model helps understand key factors affecting survival rates and provides a foundation for applying machine learning to real-world classification problems.

🚀 Project Overview
Objective:
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and more.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables

Feature engineering to improve model input

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key survival factors

Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier for prediction

Model evaluation using classification metrics

📊 Dataset
The project uses the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, containing passenger information including:

Passenger demographics (age, gender)

Ticket class (Pclass)

Family relationships aboard (SibSp, Parch)

Fare paid

Embarked port

Example features:

PassengerId, Survived (target)

Pclass, Name, Sex, Age

SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare

Cabin, Embarked

Dataset Source:
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

🧠 Model Used
Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian/Multinomial/Bernoulli based on feature types)

Model evaluation metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📈 Results
Achieved accuracy of approximately XX% (depending on preprocessing and feature selection)

Key features impacting survival include Sex, Age, Pclass, Fare

Visualization of survival distribution by gender, class, and age groups reveals important insights
